This is a simple project to study NUXT js, a framework for VueJs.

To create this project, I followed a crash course found in https://youtu.be/Wdmi4k7sFzU

The code is not exactly in the way the teacher presented, because sometimes I tried to do what he purposed,
and he did it in a little different way.

This project has also some things that would make no sense in a real project...  
... for example, I added the v-calendar just to learn how to handle plugins, but it does... nothing.

Also, as the intention was to understand how Nuxt works, I didn't spend time thinking about responsivity.

The reviewers that appear on the product page came from the public api  http://randomuser.me
To be able to access this endpoint, I used a CORS PROXY.
The proxy repository is https://github.com/Freeboard/thingproxy.

## To run the project, folow the steps below:

- clone the project

- go to the folder

- install dependencies, using npm install

- serve with hot reload at localhost:3000, using npm run dev
